# University of Prince Edward Island Travel Expenses Data

The University of Prince Edward Island publishes reports of employee travel expenses every month.
Unfortunately these reports are published as PDF files, making any sort of data analysis unreasonable.

Because I am interested in learning more about university travel, primarily with an eye to
understanding–and working to mitigate–its carbon footprint, it’s data analysis I want to do.

The data here is a result of a request, under the Prince Edward Island Freedom of Information and
Protection of Privacy Act, for machine readable data on travel expenses.

[This blog post](https://ruk.ca/content/where-matthew-going-and-why-he-going-there-or-looking-upei-travel-expenses)
relates the details of what I received, along with some high-level data analysis.

In this repository I'm publishing the data files I received, and edited derivatives of them.
